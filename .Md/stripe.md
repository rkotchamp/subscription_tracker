# Stripe Integration for Monthly and Annual Billing

## Overview

The Subscription Tracker App will use Stripe to manage customer billing on a monthly and annual basis. Stripe will handle payments, subscriptions, and invoices. Users will be charged based on their usage tier, as defined in our pricing plans. Annual subscriptions will offer a 20% discount compared to monthly plans, encouraging long-term commitments. Stripe's robust APIs make it ideal for handling recurring payments securely and efficiently.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. **Setting Up Stripe**

1. Create a Stripe account and set up your project in the Stripe Dashboard.
2. Generate API keys:
   - Publishable Key
   - Secret Key
3. Configure webhook endpoints for handling subscription events.

### 2. **Integrating Stripe into the App**

1. Install Stripe's Node.js SDK:
   ```bash
   npm install stripe
   ```
2. Create a server-side API route to manage Stripe interactions, including:

   - Customer creation
   - Subscription management
   - Invoice handling

3. Example API route for customer creation and subscription:

   ```javascript
   import Stripe from "stripe";
   const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);

   export default async function handler(req, res) {
     if (req.method === "POST") {
       const { email, plan, billingCycle } = req.body;

       try {
         const customer = await stripe.customers.create({
           email,
         });

         const subscription = await stripe.subscriptions.create({
           customer: customer.id,
           items: [{ price: plan }],
           billing_cycle_anchor:
             billingCycle === "annual" ? "yearly" : "monthly",
         });

         res.status(200).json({ subscription });
       } catch (error) {
         res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });
       }
     } else {
       res.setHeader("Allow", "POST");
       res.status(405).end("Method Not Allowed");
     }
   }
   ```

### 3. **Managing Plans and Pricing**

- Create plans in the Stripe Dashboard corresponding to the app’s pricing tiers.
- Use separate plan IDs for monthly and annual pricing in your API calls.

### 4. **Handling Webhooks**

Stripe sends webhooks for events like payment success, subscription renewal, and failed payments. Example webhook handler:

```javascript
import { buffer } from "micro";
import Stripe from "stripe";

const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);

export const config = {
  api: {
    bodyParser: false,
  },
};

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const buf = await buffer(req);
  const sig = req.headers["stripe-signature"];

  try {
    const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
      buf,
      sig,
      process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
    );

    if (event.type === "invoice.payment_succeeded") {
      const invoice = event.data.object;
      // Handle successful payment
    }

    res.json({ received: true });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).send(`Webhook Error: ${error.message}`);
  }
}
```

### 5. **UI for Subscription Management**

- Allow users to:
  - View their current plan and billing cycle.
  - Switch between monthly and annual subscriptions.
  - Upgrade or downgrade plans.
  - Cancel subscriptions.
- Example UI components:
  - **Pricing Page**: Displays plan options with both monthly and annual prices.
  - **Account Settings**: Shows the user’s current plan, billing cycle, and billing details.

### 6. **Testing**

- Use Stripe’s test environment to simulate transactions and subscription events.
- Verify:
  - Correct plan assignment and billing cycle.
  - Webhook handling.
  - Error handling for failed payments.

## Tools and Technologies

1. **Stripe SDK**: For payment processing.
2. **Webhook Handler**: To listen for subscription and payment events.
3. **Zod**: To validate API inputs and webhook payloads.
4. **MongoDB**: To store customer and subscription data.
5. **JWT**: To securely associate Stripe customer IDs with app users.
6. **ShadCN UI & TailwindCSS**: To build subscription management interfaces.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Handling Failed Payments

- **Solution**: Use Stripe’s dunning features to retry payments and notify users via email.

### Challenge 2: Webhook Security

- **Solution**: Validate webhook signatures to ensure event authenticity.

### Challenge 3: Plan Changes

- **Solution**: Use Stripe’s subscription update API to handle upgrades, downgrades, and billing cycle changes smoothly.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Billing Cycles**: Allow users to choose flexible billing cycles (e.g., quarterly).
2. **Usage-Based Billing**: Charge users based on actual usage metrics.
3. **Internationalization**: Support multi-currency billing for global users.
